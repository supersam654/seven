# Seven
An app to warn you if you're speeding up or slowing down too fast.

For future reference, the app is called "Seven" because the initial threshold for warning about accelerating too fast was 7 MPH/s. There's a very good chance this number changes or at least becomes configurable which will make the name seem fairly out of place.
